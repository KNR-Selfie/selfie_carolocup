Racecar Simulator
=================
Forked from www.github.com/mlab-upenn/racecar-simulator, which was forked from
www.github.com/mit-racecar/racecar-simulator. 

Used Google Sketchup to model Levine Building at Penn, 2nd floor hallways right
outside the mLab. Added a .dae file. World units are in meters and are pretty
accurate based on architectural floor plans obtained from the University.
